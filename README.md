# MIRROR CHALLENGE

You find yourself inside an ancient Android app. Hidden within its depths lies a forbidden vault guarded by its Keeperâ€”the ProGuard. But the Keeper, though strong, has left a clue. "Seek the mirror and whisper its secrets, for the Keeper has made a grave mistake: the locks remain, but the keys are in plain sight."
